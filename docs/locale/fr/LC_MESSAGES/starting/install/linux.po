"Some older versions of RHEL and CentOS come with Python 2.4 which is "

"You do not need to install or configure anything else to use Python. "
"Having said that, I would strongly recommend that you install the tools "
"and libraries described in the next section before you start building "
"Python applications for real-world use. In particular, you should always "
"install Setuptools and pip, as it makes it much easier for you to use "
"other third-party Python libraries."

"A Virtual Environment is a tool to keep the dependencies required by "
