"In Python, everything is an object, and can be handled as such. This is what "

"In some architectures, typically web applications, multiple instances of "
"Python processes are spawned to respond to external requests that can happen "

"objects, which means keeping some static information about the world, is "
"prone to concurrency problems or race-conditions. Sometimes, between the "
"initialization of the state of an object (usually done with the "
"``__init__()`` method) and the actual use of the object state through one of "
"its methods, the world may have changed, and the retained state may be "
"outdated. For example, a request may load an item in memory and mark it as "
"read by a user. If another request requires the deletion of this item at the "
"same time, it may happen that the deletion actually occurs after the first "
"process loaded the item, and then we have to mark as read a deleted object."
