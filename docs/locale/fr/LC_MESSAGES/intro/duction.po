"Python is a general-purpose, high-level programming language similar to "
"Tcl, Perl, Ruby, Scheme, or Java. Some of its main key features include:"

"Python's philosophy focuses on readability, from code blocks delineated "
"with significant whitespace to intuitive keywords in place of inscrutable"

"Python is sometimes described with the words \"batteries included\" "
"because of its extensive `standard library "
"<http://docs.python.org/library/>`_, which includes modules for regular "
"expressions, file IO, fraction handling, object serialization, and much "
"more."

"Additionally, the `Python Package Index <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/>`_ "
"is available for users to submit their packages for widespread use, "
"similar to Perl's `CPAN <http://www.cpan.org>`_. There is a thriving "
"community of very powerful Python frameworks and tools like the `Django "
"<http://www.djangoproject.com>`_ web framework and the `NumPy "
"<http://numpy.scipy.org>`_ set of math routines."

"Python can integrate with `Java libraries <http://www.jython.org>`_, "
"enabling it to be used with the rich Java environment that corporate "
