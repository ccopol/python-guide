"Most WSGI applications are responding to HTTP requests to serve content "
"in HTML or other markup languages. Instead of generating directly textual"
" content from Python, the concept of separation of concerns advises us to"
" use templates. A template engine manages a suite of template files, with"
" a system of hierarchy and inclusion to avoid unnecessary repetition, and"
" is in charge of rendering (generating) the actual content, filling the "
"static content of the templates with the dynamic content generated by the"
" application."

"Template files should be passed only the dynamic content that is needed "
"for rendering the template. Avoid the temptation to pass additional "

"needed than to remove a likely unused variable later."

"Many template engines allow for complex statements or assignments in the "
