"Vim is a text editor which uses keyboard shortcuts for editing instead of"

"editor to aid Python development. If you only develop in Python, a good "
"start is to set the default settings for indentation and line-wrapping to"
" values compliant with :pep:`8`. In your home directory, open a file "
"called :file:`.vimrc` and add the following lines::"
